# Monitoring Objects Configuration

## Objects

By adding the variable `icinga2_objects` the role Icinga 2 will
generate configuration files with objects included.

This variable consists of Icinga 2 object attributes and attributes referring to the file created in the process.

> **_NOTE:_** The second level of the dictionary defines on which host the configuration is created. All objects in the example below, will be gathered and deployed on the host.: `host.example.org`.  
In addition this variable can be logically defined at the **host_vars/agent** and are still deployed on the master **host.example.org**.  
The second level can **only** be used in **hostvars**!

The `file` key will be used to control in which directory structure the object will be placed.
In addition the `order` key will define the order of the objects in the destination file.
The default for `order` is set to **10**, so everything below that number will be in front of the file, all objects with the order above 10 will be placed later in the file.

The `type` will be the original Icinga 2 object types, a list of all can be found in the documentation. [Icinga 2 Monitoring Objects](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/09-object-types/#monitoring-objects)

### Icinga2 Objects in Hostvars

When defining `icinga2_objects` as a host specific variable (hostvars/groupvars) you can define the variable as a dictionary. Each dictionary key represents the host on which the key's value will be deployed as configuration.  
Alternatively you can define `icinga2_objects` as a list which results in the configuration being deployed on just the host for which the variable is defined.

Example defining the variable within hostvars as a dictionary (inventory entry):

```yaml
webserver.example.org:
  ansible_host: 10.0.0.8
  icinga2_objects:
    host.example.org:
      - name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        type: Host
        file: "{{ 'conf.d/' + ansible_hostname + '.conf' }}"
        address: "{{ ansible_host }}"
        check_command: hostalive
        check_interval: 3m
      - ...
```

This way you can use some host's variables (like `ansible_host`) to deploy configuration on another host (in this case `host.example.org`).

Example defining the variable within hostvars as a list (inventory entry):

```yaml
webserver.example.org:
  ansible_host: 10.0.0.8
  icinga2_objects:
    - name: "web-api-user"
      type: ApiUser
      file: "{{ 'conf.d/' + ansible_hostname + '.conf' }}"
      password: "somepassword"
      permissions:
        - "objects/query/Host"
        - "objects/query/Service"
    - ...
```

In the above case the list `icinga2_objects` will only be deployed as configuration on host `webserver.example.org`.

Additionally, the list `icinga2_objects` from within a play's `vars` key will be merged with each host's individual objects.

### Icinga2 Objects in Play Vars

If you need to deploy certain Icinga 2 objects on every host in your play, you can define the variable `icinga2_objects` as a list within your play's `vars` key.  
This ensures that, **in addition** to the individual host's objects, there is a common set of objects between your hosts.

Example defining the variable within your play's vars:

```
icinga2_objects:
  - name: "GlobalApiUser"
    type: ApiUser
    file: "conf.d/global_api_users.conf"
    order: 20
    password: supersecrectpassword123
    permissions:
      - "objects/query/Host"
      - "objects/query/Service"
```

## Managing Config directories

To create or prepare the directories for the monitoring configuration use the variable `icinga2_config_directories`.
Those directories are only managed when they are part of `zones.d`, `conf.d` or the variable `icinga2_confd`.

```
icinga2_config_directories:
  - zones.d/main/hosts/
  - zones.d/main/services/
  - conf.d/commands/
```

### Custom configuration files

In some cases Icinga 2 DSL can be complex and uneasy to write into YAML format. For those scenarios you can provide own files on the
Ansible controller node and let the role deploy the file to your instance.

Create the custom file below an Ansible **files/** directory and use the variable **icinga2_custom_config**

```
icinga2_custom_config:
  - name: myown_command.conf
    path: zones.d/main/myown_command.conf
    order: 10
```

## Parser Rules

The collection provides the possibility to deploy Icinga 2 configuration, this includes configuration to shape the instance and monitoring data to create a complete monitoring environment.

### Basic Syntax

The parser takes every value in the configuration and decides how the value should be written in the configuration. This takes a few rules to handle the configuration the right way.

First of all, to disable the parser use the prefix `-:`.

```
attr: -:"unparsed quoted string"
```

Strings are parsed in chunks, by splitting the original string into separate substrings at specific keywords (operators) such as `+`, `-`, `in`, `&&`, `||`, etc.

**NOTICE:** This splitting only works for keywords that are surrounded by whitespace, e.g.:

```
attr: string1 + string2 - string3
```

The algorithm will loop over the parameter and start by splitting it into 'string1' and 'string2 - string3'. 'string1' will be passed to the sub function 'value_types' and then the algorithm will continue parsing the rest of the string ('string2 - string3'), splitting it, passing it to value_types, etc.

Brackets are parsed for expressions:

```
attr: 3 * (value1 -  value2) / 2
```

The parser also detects function calls and will parse all parameters separately.

```
attr: function(param1, param2, ...)
```

Boolean values can be defined with or without quotes. In addition the Ansible bool types `yes` or `no` can be used either.

```
attr: true or attr: 'true'
```

To avoid overlapping syntax with Ansible variable syntax, please refer to single quotes `' '` when using own lambda functions in Icinga.

```
attrs => '{{ ... }}'
```

In general all values can be defined without quotes except for lamba functions where Ansible's own syntax would interfere with the double brackets.

| Type           | Examples                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Boolean        | `true`,`false`,`True`,`False`,`yes`,`no` |
| Numbers        | `2` or `3.5`                             |
| Time Intervals | `3m` or `3.5h`                           |
| String         | `attr: string`                           |

### Advanced Syntax

To replicate Icinga 2 advanced syntax like assignments with `+=` or `-=` you can use the prefix `+` or `-`.

To create the following Icinga 2 DSL syntax,
```
var += config
```
simply use a string with the prefix `+` e.g.

```
var: `+ config`
```

Because of the blank between the `+` and `config` those values are separately parsed and therefore numbers are also possible. For numbers we also can build `-=`, just use the minus sign `-`. This method will work for every attribute or custom attribute.

```
attr: + -14 or attr: - -14
```

The parser is able to merge or reduce an array. For this method set the first item of your array as `+` or `-` sign.

```
attr:
  - +
  - item1
  - item2

# Alterntive syntax
attr: ['-','item1','item2']
```
Result in Icinga will be `attr += [ "item1", "item2", ]`.

To reduce arrays use the minus sign `-`.

**NOTICE** Please be aware that the minus sign needs to be quoted otherwise the Ansible parser will have troubles reading the array.

```
attr:
  - '-'
  - item1
  - item2

# Alterntive syntax
attr: ['-','item1','item2']
```

Result in Icinga will be `attr -= [ "item1", "item2", ]`.

#### Dictionaries

To merge dictionaries we can use the plus sign `+`. The plus sign needs to be a key in the dictionary. See following example.

```
attr:
  +: true
  key1: value1
```

The result:

```
attr["key1"] = "value1"
```

The useage of levels in dictionaries aren't limited.

```
attr:
  key1:
    key2:
      key3:
        +: true
        value: test
```

Result:

```
vars.attr["key1"] = {
    key2 = {
      key3 += {
        value = "test"
      }
    }
  }
```
